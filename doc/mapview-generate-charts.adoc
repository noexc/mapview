= `mapview-generate-charts`

Generate pretty graphs containing information collected via telemetry downlink.

== How it works

`mapview-generate-charts` reparses the raw log and generates graphs using the
awesome link:https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Chart[Chart] library. In the
file, you'll find function definitions for various kinds of charts. You will
need to modify these, assuming that your telemetry sends information differently
than how NOEXC does it. The definitions should be fairly straightforward. Once
you've modified it, simply run `mapview-generate-charts` and the charts will be
placed in the `charts/` directory as SVG files.

You can optionall call `mapview-generate-charts` with the `-w` flag which will
tell it to output MediaWiki markup for a gallery view of the images, at the same
time, though uploading the images to a wiki is still a manual process.
